This is a version of cpu-gpu-ram's py-man rewritten in C++. I did this as a way to properly learn the basics of the lang.

To get started, copy the following into your terminal.

```
git clone -b cpp-man --single-branch https://github.com/cpu-gpu-ram/py-man.git/
cd py-man
chmod +x install.sh
g++ main.cpp
```
